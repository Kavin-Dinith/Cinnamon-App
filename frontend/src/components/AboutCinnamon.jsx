        What is Ceylon Cinnamon?

        Ceylon Cinnamon, also known as “True Cinnamon,” is a natural spice
        native to Sri Lanka. It is harvested from the inner bark of the
        Cinnamomum verum tree and is widely recognized for its delicate aroma,
        health benefits, and premium quality. Unlike common cassia cinnamon,
        Ceylon Cinnamon contains very low levels of coumarin, making it safe
        for daily consumption.
